Adam Number Verification System – Question

A high-security digital system is designed to validate special mirrored numbers known as Adam Numbers before granting access to sensitive data.

When a user enters a numeric code, the system performs a dual verification process:

- It calculates the square of the entered number.
- It reverses the number and calculates the square of the reversed value.
- Finally, it checks whether both results are mirror images (reverses) of each other.

A number is called an Adam Number if:
The square of the number and the square of its reverse are reverses of each other.

Task:
Write a Python program to check whether a given number is an Adam Number or not.

Examples:

Input:
12
Output:
Adam Number

Input:
13
Output:
Not an Adam Number

Input:
11
Output:
Adam Number

Example:
12 → 12² = 144, reverse(12) = 21 → 21² = 441 → reverse of 144

```python
n = int(input("Enter number: "))

temp = n
rev = 0
while temp > 0:
    rev = rev * 10 + temp % 10
    temp //= 10

square_n = n * n

square_rev = rev * rev

temp = square_n
rev_square = 0
while temp > 0:
    rev_square = rev_square * 10 + temp % 10
    temp //= 10

if square_rev == rev_square:
    print("Adam Number")
else:
    print("Not an Adam Number")
```
